# Telecom-Churn-Case-Study
Telecom Churn Case Study using XGBoost

Some of the steps that you can use are as follows:

## Data Understanding, Preparation, and Pre-Processing :
- Data understanding, identification of potentially useful and non-useful attributes and variable importance and impact estimation
- Data preparation, performing data cleaning, missing values imputation, outlier removal, and column level standardization (for e.g., date, etc.) into one format
 
## Exploratory Data Analysis :
- Performing basic preliminary data analysis including finding the correlation between variables and scatter plots to identify relationships between variables
- Performing advanced data analysis, including plotting relevant heatmaps, histograms, and basic clustering to find patterns in the data
 
## Feature Engineering and Variable Transformation :
- Feature engineering and performing one or more methods on attributes that can lead to the creation of a new potentially useful variable; for e.g., day from the date
- Variable transformation and applying categorical variable transformations to turn into numerical data and numerical variable transformations to scale data
 
## Model Selection, Model Building, and  Prediction :
- Identifying the type of problem and making a list of decisive models from all available choices
- Choosing a training mechanism; for e.g., cross-validation, etc., and tuning hyperparameters of each model
- Testing each model on the respective model evaluation metric
- Choosing the best model based on the fit of the data set and output variable
- Using ensemble options to improve the efficacy based on the evaluation metric stated in the problem
